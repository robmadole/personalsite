<h3>Wanted: band members for an upcoming tour</h3>

<p>A job posting for a software engineer is similar to an advertisement for a band member. It can be boiled down to two basic questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do you play our kind of music?</li>
  <li>Can you play a specific instrument?</li>
</ul>

<h3>We typically focus more on the instrument</h3>

<p>Playing guitar doesn't necessarily mean that you play Rock-n-Roll.
Knowing Java doesn't necessarily mean that you write "enterprise" software.
There is a nuance that I've learned is more important: <strong>your
software engineering genre</strong>.</p>







<p>This is key and when we accept a job at a new company or we hire a new team member this is largely ignored.</p>
